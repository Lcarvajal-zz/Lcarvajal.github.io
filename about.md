With one year of mathematics at the [Free University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_Berlin) and two years of economics and computer science at [Florida State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University), I am ready to work on cool mobile apps that solve problems in education, health, and limited internet.

### The Backstory

I love soccer, triathlon, piano!
