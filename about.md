With one year of mathematics at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_Berlin" target="_blank">Free University of Berlin</a> and two years of economics and computer science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University" target="_blank">Florida State</a>, I am ready to work on cool mobile apps that solve problems in education, health, and limited internet.

### The Backstory
