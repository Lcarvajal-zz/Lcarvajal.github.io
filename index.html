<h3>Big Moments in My Past</h3>
<br>
I was born and raised in Miami by an awesome German mom and cool Ecuadorian dad!<br><br>

In Pennsylvania, I flew my first plane. Landing a plane with three people's lives in my hands was the scariest moment of my life.<br><br>

For two years I played for a youth professional soccer team sponsored by the Italian club Cagliari F.C.<br><br>

The first piano concerto I learned was Chopin Concerto No. 1 in E Minor. Chopin is my favorite composer.<br><br>

For a year I studied economics, math, and computer science at Florida State, but felt I could never be a great economist if I wasn't getting a solid background in mathematics.<br><br>

So I moved to Belin to study mathematics and computational science at the Free University of Berlin. There I met so many smart people from all over the world. I fell in love with their tech scene. After a year, I wanted to leave university to work at a friend's startup, but I chickend out when my parents said they wouldn't support me if I didn't complete my studies.<br>

So I decided to go back to Florida State where I spent my entire time building mobile apps. During this time, I built an app that accessed The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal for free and gave it to all my friends.<br><br> 

After a year I didn't see the point in staying and decided to grow my freelance app business that was doing fairly well. I thought Chicago's tech scene seemed like a place where I could make it happen, so I bought a one-way ticket and didn't look back.<br><br>

A couple weeks after moving, my team won the Lacuna Open Build Hackathon. We won a free year of office space in Chicago. Two weeks later, Tip Yourself hired me to fix their app.<br><br>

In four months I turned Tip Yourself into an app that won Best New App by The Apple App Store.<br><br>
