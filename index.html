               <h3>Founding Apps by Lukas</h3>
               <p>
                During college, I really wanted to have financial independence so I could do whatever I wanted. So I set a goal of earning $10,000 over the summer.
                <br><br>
                I first tried building personal websites for people, but I made little money from it since finding clients at a college was pretty tough. I failed that summer. However, I saw mobile apps were in high demand, so I went all-in improving my app development skills.
                <br><br>
                After about six months, I built a portfolio including a merge-text app, a location-based reminder app, and an app that bypassed newspaper article paywalls. That caught the attention of a professor of mine, who connected me with someone trying to build an iOS app for their startup.
                <br><br>
                That startup ended up contracting me to build their iOS, Android, and web apps. That quickly turned into me leading small teams to build apps for different clients. I made well over $10,000 the following summer, graduated early, and moved to Chicago to build my business.

               <h3>Co-founding Tip Yourself</h3>
               <p>
                My passion for improving education stems from it being a major factor in economic empowerment. So when Tip Yourself hired Apps by Lukas to develop their iOS app, I got really excited about building a community of people motivating each other to save money.
                <br><br>
                During my first three months working with them, I revamped the entire app and designed a new bank sign up flow that increased their users from 300 to over 30,000. When I then solved an authentication problem an experienced consultant couldn't figure out, Tip Yourself asked me to join as co-founder and CTO.
                <br><br>
                It was a wild ride where we almost got into Tech Stars and Y Combinator, became a Top 20 Finance app on the App Store, and eventually got aquired by Earnin.
                <br><br>
                To write software that managed millions of dollars of people's money when I was 21 built a lot of confidence in my ability to lead larger and more complex projects.

               <p>
                I joined Mimo because I felt I had some experience building businesses and coding, but not really any industry experience in my biggest passion, education.
                <br><br>
                My first project was launching a course for Kotlin, but after a few weeks I jumped on opportunities to lead cross-functional teams for the first few iterations of challenges, improving our internal tools, and building our content management lifecycle.
                <br><br>
                My proudest achievements are my initiatives that shifted our company from a bunch of individuals focused on different goals, to teams of people making progress on a few important company goals.

               <h3>3x Hackathon Winner</h3>
               <p>
                I love hackathons because I love the feeling of building something useful in a couple of days.
                <br><br>
                In 2015, my team won the Lacuna Open Build Hackathon for building a location-based social media app that encourage people to interact with each other in large office spaces.
                <br><br>
                In 2018, my team won the Mimo Company Hackathon for building a practice session generator that invented practice questions and interactions on its own. The proof-of-concept lead to a practice generation feature that saves course creators a few hours of work each week.
                <br><br>
                In 2019, my team won the Mimo Company Hackathon for building a one-click publish and one-click preview feature, which saved hours of work each week for course creators and developers.

         <h1>The German Ecuadorian</h1>
         <p>
          My parents come from Ecuador and Germany, and decided to raise me in the US. While they raised me, they pushed me to become a good piano player and a good soccer player. Building those skills over several years taught me how to develop skills that take time and connect with all kinds of different people.
          <br><br>
          How I was raised shaped two beliefs in how I approach life. First, anyone can learn pretty much any thing. The factors that stop someone from learning are economic, motivational, opportunities to develop a skill, and knowledge gaps. Those things can be hard to fix, but are addressable with great teachers empowered by good policy and great educational products.
          <br><br>
          Second, everyone has a reason for doing things. The main reason is the environment they grew up in. If you listen to where a person comes from, you can start a conversation on where they should go. That's the best way to connect with someone, but like any other skill understanding takes time to develop.
          <br><br>
          When I explore the world and I can't speak the language, I fall back on my skills to build relationships. Playing a pick up game of soccer in China, playing a song from Mozart in Brazil, or cooking a Georgian dish in Georgia, are things that make a foreigner feel less foreign.
          <br><br>
          A great education is what shaped me into the person I am today. By dedicating my life to improving educationg, I'm aiming to create opportunities and build common ground for millions of others.
