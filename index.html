	At 19, Lukas was studying pure mathematics at the <a href="http://appsbylukas.com">Free University of Berlin</a>. 

	Inspired by the Berlin tech scene, he set out to earn ten thousand dollars so that he could fund his own startup.<br><br>

	In pursuit of this goal, Lukas built mobile apps for small startups which turned into <a href="http://appsbylukas.com">Apps by Lukas</a>.<br><br>

	After developing apps for over two years, Lukas began working on Tip Yourself which at the time only had around 100 users. Within three months he turned it into a Best New App on the Apple App Store, brought in over 30,000 downloads, and reached the 19th spot for Top Finance Apps on the Apps Store.
