	Lukas studied pure mathematics at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Berlin">Free University of Berlin</a> and economics/computer science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University">Florida State University</a>.<br><br>

	Inspired by the Berlin tech scene, he set out to earn ten thousand dollars so that he could fund his own startup. So he began building iOS and Android apps for small startups. This later turned into <a href="http://appsbylukas.com">Apps by Lukas</a>.<br><br>

	At 21 and in search of more fulfilling work, Lukas began working on Tip Yourself. At the time, it only had 100 users. Within three months he turned it into a Best New App on the Apple App Store, brought in over 30,000 downloads, and reached the 19th spot for Top Finance Apps on the Apps Store.<br><br>

	Today, Lukas is the CTO of Tip Yourself, advises young startups, and spends his free time playing the piano, soccer, and chess.
