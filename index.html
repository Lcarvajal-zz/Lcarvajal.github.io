<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
	Welcome to my personal page! Here you'll find some information about my background, a blog explaining some of my programming, and links to my work. Freelance is where you can see some of my web and app projects if you are looking to hire me as a developer, while my github may be a better place to look at my work if you want to see the quality of my code. Hope you find all that you need! If you have any questions, feel free to email me with the mail icon below or find my email address in the
