<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my personal page! 

<br><br>Here you'll find some information about my background, a blog explaining some of my programming experiences, and links to my work. 

<br><br>Freelance is where you can view some of my web and app projects if you are looking to hire me as a developer, while my github may be a better place to look at my work if you want to see the quality of my code. 

<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to email me with the mail icon below or find my email address in the
	<a href="about.md">
		about 
	</a>
section of this site.
