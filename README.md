### My personal page
[by Lukas Carvajal](http://lukascarvajal.com)

My site is used to display some information about me, while also providing links to view projects, my resume, and even more info about me! I am also keeping my blog on there.

Currently the site uses Jekyll to maintain my blog, bootstrap to give it a good look, and rails to build the entire site.
