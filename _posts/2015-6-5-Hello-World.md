Just got a couple sites up and running, including this blog on github. I am using Amazon s3 to host awesome websites that use html, css, and javascript, which is enough to display information and build a presence on the web. Check out my page to see [my sites and mobile apps](https://lukascarvajal.neocities.org)!
