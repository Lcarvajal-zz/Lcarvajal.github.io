title: First blog post!

Just got a couple sites up and running, including this blog on github. I am using [neocities](https://neocities.org) to build awesome websites that use html, css, and javascript, which is enough to display information and build a presence on the web. Hosting is free, so pretty much the only yearly cost for these sites are domain name fees. Check out my page for [my services](https://lukascarvajal.neocities.org)!
